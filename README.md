## 📚 Publications & Pre-prints

### 2025

#### **Computation and Language (`cs.CL`)**

**1. The Fragility of Guardrails: Cognitive Jamming and Repetition Collapse in Safety-Steered LLMs**
* **Author:** Ekjot Singh
* **Abstract:** Investigates the mechanistic underpinnings of safety guardrails in LLMs using Sparse Autoencoders. We identify specific features responsible for "refusal" behaviors and demonstrate "Cognitive Jamming," where over-steering these safety features induces catastrophic "Repetition Collapse," highlighting the brittleness of current alignment paradigms.

#### **Computer Vision (`cs.CV`)**

**1. Dataset Distillation for the Pre-Training Era: Cross-Model Generalization via Linear Gradient Matching**
* **Author:** Ekjot Singh
* **Abstract:** Introduces a novel approach to dataset distillation tailored for the pre-training era, focusing on cross-model generalization capabilities through linear gradient matching techniques.

**2. Revisiting AlexNet: Achieving High-Accuracy on CIFAR-10 with Modern Optimization Techniques**
* **Author:** Ekjot Singh
* **Abstract:** We revisit the original AlexNet architecture, adapting it for CIFAR-10 and achieving **95.7% accuracy** by incorporating modern techniques like Batch Normalization, Adam optimizer, and advanced regularization.
